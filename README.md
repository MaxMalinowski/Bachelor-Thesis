# Abstract
Cloud Computing is already in extensive use by many car manufacturers in their backend, providing scalability, performance, and availability. 
However, the in-vehicle software is still definitely bound and statically executed on particular hardware. 
This thesis explores the basic feasibility and performance of operating an OpenStack cloud on automotive hardware for in-vehicle use. 
For evaluation, the introduced overhead and the cases of VM distribution and VM migration are considered and examined. 
Two automotive ARM SoCs and two high-performance x86 platforms are used for measurements and evaluation. 
The results indicate that on both hardware, OpenStack is executable and operable. 
On performable hardware, the results reveal OpenStack to introduce a low overhead and function reliably. 
However, low resources can influence OpenStackâ€™s performance. Furthermore, VM migration and distribution were found to be practicable, although not for real-time applications.
